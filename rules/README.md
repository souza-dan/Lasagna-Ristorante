# Lasagna Ristorante: A Ristor For Ants

# Story
Tomorrow is the grand opening of the soon to be world famous Lasagna Ristorante! Tonight's very special guest is a food critic whose review will decide the fate of the restaurant.

Because of your vast lasagna knowledge, you have been recruited as chefs to create the perfect lasagna to convince the critic to write a glowing review.

As you don your chef hats, a few are missing the regulation Rats and instead have Ants inside!

Much to your surprise, the freshly constructed Ristorante was built on top of an anthill filled with those zombie ants. Upset about being displaced from their home, the chefs with an ant in their cap are compelled to ruin the lasagna! It’s up to the rat chefs to deliver a culinary masterpiece to wow the critic and save the Lasagna Ristorante!

# Objective
The chefs have 3 chances to Bake a Lasagna.

The chefs with Rats under their Hats want to create a Lasagna, which must contain a Noodle, Tomato, and two kinds of Cheese.
The chefs with Ants under their Hats want to sabotage the Lasagna. A Lasagna missing any of the Core ingredients or containing a Bad ingredient ruins the Lasagna.

If 4 turns go by without adding an Ingredient to the Lasagna, the Lasagna will be Baked.

# Setup
Each chef receives the following cards:
1 Hat card (face down)
1 Role card (face up)
6 Ingredient cards (face down)

Any Ingredients not dealt to chefs become the Surplus Pile.

Chefs may view his/her Ingredient cards once before the start of the game, but must shuffle and place the ingredients face down in front of them. This becomes the chef’s Pantry.
Chefs may view his/her own Hat card at any time.

# How To Play
Starting with the chef that has the Chief Chef role, chefs take turns being Head Chef.

As Head Chef, you have the option to:
1. Add an ingredient to the Lasagna
2. Restock your Pantry
3. Call a Vote to Bake the Lasagna
Some chefs have special Roles that may be used during the turn.

## Adding an Ingredient
1. Head Chef picks a Sous Chef
2. Without looking at the Ingredient, the Head Chef gives the Sous Chef an Ingredient from another 
   chef’s Pantry
3. Sous Chef picks an Ingredient from another chef’s Pantry
4. Sous Chef looks at both Ingredients and gives one or both to the Head Chef
5. The Head Chef picks one Ingredient and adds it to the Lasagna face down.

Any ingredients that are not added to the Lasagna are discarded to the Scraps Pile.


## Restock Your Pantry
Draw up to two new Ingredients to your pantry from Surplus Pile. A Pantry may not exceed 6 Ingredients. You may look at the new Ingredients, but you must shuffle them with your existing Pantry. Do not look at the cards in your existing Pantry.
If there are no Surplus ingredients left, do not draw from the Scraps Pile.

## Call a Vote to Bake the Lasagna
Baking the Lasagna reveals all the Ingredient cards in the Lasagna. If the Lasagna does not have all the required Core ingredients, the Lasagna is sent to the Scraps Pile.
All chefs Vote on whether the Lasagna should be Baked. Majority wins and Chief Chef settles ties.

# Ending the Game
The game ends when the Lasagna has all the Core Ingredients (Noodle, Tomato, 2 Types of Cheese). The game also ends after 3 Baked Lasagna attempts.
When the game ends, the critic arrives and the Chief Chef presents the lasagna for evaluation.
